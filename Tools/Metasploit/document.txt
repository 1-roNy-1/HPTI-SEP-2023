Metasploit is the world’s leading open-source penetrating framework used by security engineers 
A penetration testing system and a development platform that allows to create security tools and exploits. 
The framework makes hacking simple for both attackers and defenders
A Metasploit penetration test begins with the information gathering phase, 
wherein Matsploit integrates with various reconnaissance tools like Nmap, SNMP scanning, and Windows patch enumeration, and Nessus
To find the vulnerable spot in your system. Once the weakness is identified, choose an exploit and payload to penetrate the chink in the armor. 
If the exploit is successful, the payload gets executed at the target, and the user gets a shell to interact with the payload.
One of the most popular payloads to attack Windows systems is Meterpreter – an in-memory-only interactive shell. Once on the target machine, Metasploit offers various exploitation tools for privilege escalation, packet sniffing, pass the hash, keyloggers, screen capture, plus pivoting tools. Users can also set up a persistent backdoor if the target machine gets rebooted.
